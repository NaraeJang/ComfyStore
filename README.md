# Comfy Store

Comfy Store is a project that I completed while taking a course of React. In addition, I improved the application with extra codes in order to make it more responsive both mobile and web. Main feature is you can experience the same as when you shop on online shopping mall. you can filter products, save in the cart, see the total price when you check out, register or login as a member of the shopping mall and experience more feature when you login such as checking your order.

!ATTENTION!
If you use all the filters in Products page, you might find no product exists. It's not an error. It's because the api doesn't contains many items in the list.
