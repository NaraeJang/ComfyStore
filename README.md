# Comfy Store

Comfy Store is a project that I completed while taking a React course. Additionally, I enhanced the application by adding extra code to make it more responsive on both mobile and web, and I fixed existing errors. The main feature is that you can experience the same as when you shop on an online shopping mall. You can filter products, save them in the cart, see the total price when you check out, register or log in as a member of the shopping mall, and experience more features when you log in, such as checking your order.

!ATTENTION!
If you use all the filters on the Products page, you might find no products exist. It's not an error; it's because the API doesn't contain many items in the list.
