# Comfy Store

Comfy Store is a project that I completed while taking a React course. Additionally, I enhanced the application by adding extra code to make it more responsive on both mobile and web, and I fixed existing errors. The main feature is that you can experience the same as when you shop on an online shopping mall. You can filter products, save them in the cart, see the total price when you check out, register or log in as a member of the shopping mall, and experience more features when you log in, such as checking your order.

### React Query Integration & State Management

Leveraged React Query for optimized data caching, significantly improving loading times across various sections like featured products, checkout, and order information. Managed global application state efficiently using Redux or Context API.

### Responsive Design and Custom Theming

Implemented a responsive design strategy ensuring compatibility with different devices. Offered customizable theming options through CSS preprocessors or CSS-in-JS libraries, enabling easy modifications of styles and layouts for a personalized user experience.

### Dynamic Routing and Accessibility Compliance

Implemented dynamic routing for seamless navigation between pages. Adhered to accessibility standards by employing semantic HTML, alt tags for images, and keyboard navigation, ensuring an inclusive experience for all users.

!ATTENTION!

- If you use all the filters on the Products page, you might find no products exist. It's not an error; it's because the API doesn't contain many items in the list.
- If you use the guest user account, the values you provide for name and address are going to be different and they are going to be replaced by the server.
